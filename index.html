											<h1>Hi, I’m Thiri May<br />

											<p>Blending Financial Insight with Strategic Vision for Tomorrow’s Challenges</p>
										</header>
										<p>A curious and driven MSc. Business and Management graduate with an excitement for all things investment strategies, asset management, and consulting. My academic adventures have armed me with a solid foundation in financial analysis, decision-making technologies, and the art of business strategy. I’ve spent the last year diving deep into how cutting-edge tech can transform investment decision-making, wrapping up with a thesis on its impact in the world of asset management.</p>
										</ul>Beyond the textbooks, I’ve had the thrill of tackling real-life consulting challenges with an external client as a school project, blending my love for data with some good old-fashioned problem-solving. I’m all about connecting the dots between strategy and numbers, and I thrive when turning complex data into actionable insights. Now, I’m ready to bring that enthusiasm, entrepreneurial spark, and strategic thinking into the exciting world of finance and consulting, where I can help companies unlock their potential and make smart, data-driven decisions.<p></p>

											<h3>Dissertation</h3>
											<p>This research investigates how emerging technologies are being integrated into the asset management industry, with a focus on their influence on investment strategies, decision-making, and overall efficiency. By examining a case study of BlackRock, a leading firm in asset management, the research offers a thorough analysis of how technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and big data analytics are being used to boost capabilities.</p>
											<ul class="actions">
												<li></li>The study explores the advantages of these technologies, such as enhanced data processing, improved predictive analytics, and more effective real-time risk management, which collectively contribute to better investment decisions and optimized asset performance. It also addresses key challenges related to their adoption, including data privacy issues, algorithmic bias, and the need for organizational changes like workforce upskilling. The research indicates that while the benefits of technology integration are significant, they come with notable risks that firms need to manage carefully.</p>
											</ul class="action">
											<li></li>The research concludes that the benefits of adopting advanced technologies in asset management generally surpass the challenges, as long as firms implement strong risk management strategies and stay adaptable to technological changes. The research emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach that combines strategic foresight with practical considerations to support long-term business goals while managing potential drawbacks.</p>
										</ul class="action">	
										<li></li>Key Takeaways:
									</p>1. Focus of Study: Examines the integration of emerging technologies in asset management, particularly their effects on investment strategies, decision-making, and efficiency.</p>
								</p>2. Case Study: Utilizes BlackRock, a prominent asset management firm, to analyze the application of AI, machine learning, and big data.</p>
							</p>3. Benefits: Highlights improvements in data processing, predictive analytics, and real-time risk management that lead to better investment outcomes.</p>
						</p>4. Challenges: Identifies issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for workforce upskilling.</p>
					</p>5. Conclusion: Suggests that the advantages of technological adoption generally outweigh the challenges if firms implement effective risk management and stay adaptable.</p>
				</p>6. Future Research: Recommends further exploration of technology’s impact on regulatory practices and the long-term effects of AI and machine learning.</p>
			</p>7. Overall Contribution: Provides insights into how emerging technologies are transforming asset management and sets a foundation for future research.</p>
		</ul class="action">
		<li></li>Future research should further explore the impact of technology on regulatory practices and examine the long-term effects of AI and machine learning on the industry. Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the transformative role of emerging technologies in asset management and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this field.</p>

											<h3>Research Proposal</h3>
											<p>I developed this research proposal as part of my pre-master's studies in Business and Social Sciences.This research explores the impact of digital transformation on the global management consulting industry, focusing on the challenges and opportunities faced by firms in adapting to new technologies. The study is structured around three main objectives: (1) analyzing the innovations and digital strategies consulting firms must adopt to remain competitive, (2) comparing how leading firms like McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) approach digital transformation, and (3) examining the role of business model innovation in these transformations.</p>
											<ul class="actions">
												<li></li>The research highlights the significant influence of digitalization on the consulting industry, driven by the need for businesses to evolve their models to remain competitive. With the rise of virtualization, consulting firms are exploring ways to deliver services more efficiently, often reducing costs and expanding their client base globally.</p>
											</ul class="action">
										    	<li></li>A comparative analysis between McKinsey and BCG shows similarities in their approaches but also reveals key differences in their technological capabilities and strategic focus. The project concludes that while digitalization offers many opportunities, it requires a balance between technological innovation and human expertise to maintain the essence of consulting services.</p>
											</ul class="action">
											<li></li>Key Takeaways:
											</p>1. Digital transformation is essential for consulting firms to keep up with industry demands and maintain competitive advantages.</p>
										    </p>2. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digitalization, but long-term drivers also include shifts in industry dynamics and customer demands.</p>
										    </p>3. Both McKinsey and BCG use structured approaches to guide clients through transformation, though McKinsey faces challenges in technology, while BCG benefits from a broader tech network.</p>
										    </p>4. Business model innovation remains crucial, but human skills like problem-solving and communication are irreplaceable by technology.</p>
										</ul class="action">
										<li></li>Recommendations: More research is needed on how different consulting firms can navigate digital transformation, particularly in adapting these strategies for small and medium-sized enterprises.</ul>
